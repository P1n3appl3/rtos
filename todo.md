-   only flash when necessary (allow parallel make for compilation but with
    serial steps like flash -> debug)
-   stack protection with MPU
-   investigate static analysis for max stack usage (gcc fstack-usage)
-   printf rewrite
-   more optimal sleep scheduling (like periodic with one-shot timers)
-   check rom vs normal driverlib speed/space
-   better UART blocking for TX
-   mutual exclusion for all LCD display functions
-   rewrite screen driver
-   core temp with adc
-   LTO
-   use allocator for dynamically sized stacks and OS fifo
